        <p>I didn't use any content from other sites. I did use AI to assist with the text content of the site.<br>
        In my footer I included 2 links (Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy) from a third party page generator.<br>
        These are just there to complete the site and give it a proffesional feel.<br>
        They do not count as part of the assignment. I created 4 pages for the assignment exceeding the minimum expectation by 1: Home, FAQs, Contact, and Checkout.</p>
